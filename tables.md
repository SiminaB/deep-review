| Term          | Definition           |
| :------------- |:--------------|
| Neural network  (NN)   | Machine-learning approach where inputs are fed into one or more hidden layers, producing an outer layer |
| Deep learning (DL) approach      | NN with multiple hidden layers      | 
| Supervised learning | Machine-learning approaches with goal of prediction of labels or outcomes     | 
| Unsupervised learning | Machine-learning approaches with goal of data summarization or pattern identification |
| Convolutional neural network (CNN) | NN used for grid data - such as images or equally-spaced time points - that considers convolutions instead of linear transformations, leading to increased sparsity and thus improved efficiency |
| Recurrent neural network (RNN) | NN used for sequential data - such as time series or genomic data - by using cycles between nodes in the hidden layers  |
| Long short-term memory (LSTM) model | Special type of RNN that can learn longer-term dependencies |
| Autoencoder (AE) | NN that sets the outer layer to be similar to the input layer, used for example in dimension reduction |
